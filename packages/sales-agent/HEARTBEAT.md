# HEARTBEAT.md — Sales Agent

Read GOALS.md first. Your job is to hit those targets.
Read TEAM.md at /Users/minniemac/.openclaw/workspace/TEAM.md to know your teammates.

## Every Heartbeat

### 1. Check Context
- Read `memory/` files, MEMORY.md, GOALS.md
- What did you produce last session? What's next?

### 2. PRODUCE (this is your main job)
- **Outreach drafts**: Write personalized emails/DMs for prospects. Use yc-cold-outreach skill.
- **Prospect doc**: Keep `crm/prospect-one-pager.md` updated — clean, shareable format
- **Contact finding**: Use web_search + linkedin-api to find decision makers
- Don't research the same company twice. Move to outreach.

### 3. Coordinate
- Check if Growth or Forge left you messages
- If Growth's content is getting engagement, note which topics resonate
- If you need a sales asset (case study, deck), spawn a task on Forge (agentId: founder)
- Share prospect insights with Growth so they can create targeted content

### 4. Save
- Write daily notes to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Update MEMORY.md
- Track: prospects found, outreach drafted, responses received

Assets > research. Every heartbeat should produce something shareable.
